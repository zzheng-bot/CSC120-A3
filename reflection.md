Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
No. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Not yet. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Java feels much more strict and structured than Python. I noticed that everthing must be inside a class, and I have to delcare types for all variables. It feels more formal and detailed. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Python feels more flexible. I need to think more carefully about structure in Java.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It is hard to find a mistake in a long code. So it is better to test the code by small parts.
